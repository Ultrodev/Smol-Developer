Shared Dependencies:

1. **Tailwind CSS**: This is a utility-first CSS framework that is used for styling all the HTML files. It is included in the "tailwind.css" file and is linked in the head of each HTML file.

2. **CSS Styles**: The "styles.css" file contains custom styles that are used across all the HTML files. It is linked in the head of each HTML file.

3. **DOM Element IDs**: These are unique identifiers for HTML elements that can be used by JavaScript functions. Shared IDs across the files could include "header", "footer", "main", "nav", "mobileNav", "desktopNav", "productList", "countryList", etc.

4. **Assets**: The "assets/images/", "assets/fonts/", and "assets/icons/" directories contain resources that are used across multiple HTML files. The specific files within these directories would be referenced in the HTML and CSS files.

5. **Data Schemas**: If the website uses any kind of dynamic data (for example, product or country information), there would likely be a shared data schema that defines the structure of this data. This could include fields like "productName", "productDescription", "productImage", "countryName", "countryDescription", etc.

6. **Function Names**: If there are shared JavaScript functions across the files, these would also be a shared dependency. Examples could include "toggleNav()", "loadProducts()", "loadCountries()", etc.

7. **Message Names**: If the website uses any kind of messaging system (for example, for form submissions or notifications), there would likely be shared message names. Examples could include "formSubmissionSuccess", "formSubmissionError", "notificationMessage", etc.
